# Task 1: Information about io_uring source
List in this section source and headers of io_uring. For each of the C source/header, you must put description what's the prime responsibily of the source. Take notes, description of the source should be slightly technical like the example given. 

## Source
### advice.c
Store io_madvice & io_fadvice structures, both have the same exact attributes. Which make them basically the same thing. Except function body treat them as separate. Codes which make use of io_madvice are guarded by compilation macro, which make its relevant functions only active if the build flag is set. But functions that make use of io_fadvice are active all the time. The exact difference between io_madvice & io_fadvice will only known after exploring do_madvise function for io_madvice & vfs_fadvise function for io_fadvice

### alloc_cache.c
Implement memory cache allocation system for io_uring in order to minimize leftover allocation or deallocation in memory. io_alloc_cache_init() is used for initialize a cache with a fixed entries and io_alloc_cache_free() is used to release the cached memory. io_cache_alloc_new() is useed for handling new memory allocation using kmalloc with an option of init_clear. The function in this source all work together for an efficient memory management

### cancel.c
This file handles cancelling io_uring requests that are still in progress. It includes support for cancelling one request or multiple requests at once, based on different flags like file descriptor, operation type, or user data. It checks whether the request matches the cancel conditions and tries to stop it, whether it’s in the queue, running, or already submitted. It also supports both async and sync cancel operations.

### epoll.c
This source file implements io_uring support for epoll operations. It handles both epoll_ctl (adding/modifying/removing watched file descriptors) and epoll_wait (waiting for events). The file defines internal structures (io_epoll, io_epoll_wait) and provides setup and execution logic. It supports non-blocking operation and integrates with io_uring's request processing framework

### eventfd.c
This file implements support for integrating eventfd signaling with io_uring. It provides registration and unregistration of eventfds (io_eventfd_register, io_eventfd_unregister), as well as logic to signal or flush the eventfd when new completions are posted to the completion queue. It carefully uses RCU and reference counting to ensure safe access to the eventfd context across concurrent operations, supporting both synchronous and asynchronous triggering depending on configuration

### fdinfo.c
This file provides support for displaying detailed information about io_uring file descriptors in ~/fdinfo. It outputs internal state such as SQ/CQ positions, registered files and buffers, SQ thread stats, and overflow data, which is useful for debugging and performance monitoring when CONFIG_PROC_FS is enabled

### filetable.c
This file is responsible for managing file descriptors in the io_uring context. It handles the allocation and deallocation of file slots in the file table, including assigning files to specific slots, managing a bitmap to track available slots, and ensuring proper cleanup when a file is no longer needed. The functions allow for dynamically allocating file slots, installing files into those slots, and removing files when necessary. The overall purpose is to efficiently manage file resources within io_uring, ensuring proper handling of file descriptors in a scalable way

### fs.c
This code provides functions to handle file system operations like renaming, deleting, creating directories, and creating symbolic or hard links using io_uring. These operations are designed to work asynchronously, meaning they don't block the system while they are being processed. The code ensures the correct handling of file paths, flags, and error checking, making sure resources are properly managed and cleaned up after each operation. It allows for faster file handling in applications that need high performance and non-blocking I/O.

### futex.c
This code helps manage asynchronous input/output operations. The io_futex structure holds information about a futex, such as its user-space address and various flags. The code includes functions to set up and clean up a cache for futex data, prepare futex requests, and complete them when done. It also has functions to cancel ongoing futex operations and to wait for or wake up threads that are using futexes.

### io_uring.c
This file handles the core functionality of io_uring. It is responsible for setting up and managing the submission and completion queues, processing requests, and managing the task context for I/O operations. The primary role of io_uring.c is to implement functions that deal with submitting I/O requests (like reads, writes, and other operations) to the kernel and completing them asynchronously

### io_wq.c
The primary responsibility of io_wq.c is to handle workqueue operations for io_uring. It implements functions that manage the scheduling and execution of tasks in the background via workqueues. This file sets up and manages workqueue entries and their associated tasks, such as submitting and completing I/O operations

### kbuf.c
the function in this file is to manage buffer allocations for io_uring operations. It provides functions to allocate and free memory buffers used for I/O operations. Specifically, it manages kernel memory buffers that are used by the io_uring subsystem for holding data during I/O operations, ensuring that buffers are efficiently allocated and released

### memmap.c:
this file provides the implementation for memory management in the io_uring subsystem, which is used for efficient asynchronous I/O operations in Linux. It contains functions for allocating and deallocating memory for I/O buffers. The key functions include memory allocation for large buffers, pinning user-space memory to prevent swapping, and unpinning/releasing memory when it's no longer needed. It also handles specific memory regions for I/O and ensures the memory is mapped correctly for the kernel's access

### msg_ring.c:
This file implements the message ring buffer mechanism used in the io_uring system for communication between kernel and user-space. It handles the initialization, processing, and synchronization of the message ring buffers, which are used to store and pass I/O request messages. This includes managing the submission queue (SQ) and completion queue (CQ) to facilitate efficient message passing and handling

### napi.c:
This file is responsible for implementing the NAPI (New API) framework. NAPI uses a polling technique to process network packets, reducing interrupt overhead and improving performance, especially in high-throughput systems. It allows the kernel to handle multiple packets in a batch.

### net.c:
This file is part of the system's network protocol implementation and handles tasks like initializing network devices, managing network buffers, setting up protocols (e.g., TCP/IP), and handling socket communication.

### nop.c
Implements the io_nop request, a placeholder operation that performs no actual I/O but still goes through the full request submission and completion cycle. Useful for testing, benchmarking, or triggering completion dependencies without side effects. Although the operation is functionally empty, it interacts with core request lifecycle mechanisms, making it relevant for validating the ring’s internal state transitions. The handler is registered in the operation dispatch table and tagged with minimal requirements

### notif.c
Handles asynchronous notification infrastructure for io_uring, allowing event-based signaling from the kernel to userspace. This file sets up io_notif request types and manages lifecycle events associated with notification delivery. It defines how notifications are armed, triggered, and completed, using internal state transitions to track pending vs. completed notifications. It also includes setup for multishot notification handling, which allows multiple completions from a single request.

### opdef.c
Defines the operation registration and dispatch mechanism for all io_uring opcodes. A static table maps opcodes like IORING_OP_READ, IORING_OP_WRITE, IORING_OP_TIMEOUT, etc., to their respective handler functions. Each entry includes metadata such as whether the op requires registration, supports fixed files, needs async handling, or allows linked execution. This table is used during request submission to dispatch the request to the correct handler

### openclose.c
Implements file system open and close operations in the context of io_uring, specifically IORING_OP_OPENAT, IORING_OP_OPENAT2, and IORING_OP_CLOSE. Wraps around VFS-level calls (do_sys_openat2, ksys_close) and handles path resolution, permission checks, and file descriptor assignment. Includes logic for passing credentials and resolving file paths in user memory. Since these ops may block (e.g., path lookup), async context support is integrated

### poll.c
Implements polling logic for readiness-based I/O, supporting operations like IORING_OP_POLL_ADD and IORING_OP_POLL_REMOVE. Interfaces directly with the kernel’s poll_wait() system and sets up callback-driven completion, allowing the ring to signal when a file descriptor is readable or writable. Supports edge-triggered and level-triggered polling depending on how the mask is set. Implements cancellation logic using request keys, allowing polling requests to be forcefully removed.

### register.c
Handles registration and deregistration of ring resources such as user buffers (IORING_REGISTER_BUFFERS), files (IORING_REGISTER_FILES), and user credentials (IORING_REGISTER_PERSONALITY). The file includes validation for user pointers, locking and memory pinning logic to secure user pages, and efficient lookup structures (e.g., fixed file slots). Integrates with rsrc.c for resource tracking. Uses kernel refcounting and RCU to safely manage resources across multiple requests and threads. Implements fallback paths for failed registrations and ensures resources are released cleanly on ring exit or task death

### rsrc.c
Works closely with register.c to manage the lifecycle of registered resources. Implements structures and helpers for managing file and buffer slots in a scalable and thread-safe manner. Uses xarrays or red-black trees internally for lookup and updates. Provides APIs for resolving a fixed file slot or buffer ID into a usable kernel pointer during request processing. Also includes cleanup paths for resource replacement, retirement, and unregistration. Carefully manages synchronization using RCU, reference counting, and mutexes to handle concurrent access across requests

### rw.c
Handles all read and write operations submitted to the ring, including IORING_OP_READ, IORING_OP_WRITE, IORING_OP_READ_FIXED, and IORING_OP_WRITE_FIXED. Wraps around low-level I/O functions like vfs_read, vfs_write, and their direct I/O equivalents. Handles setup of kiocb structures, buffer selection (user vs registered buffers), and async context preparation. Also contains retry paths for short reads/writes, and integration with I/O polling or completion callbacks. 

### splice.c
Implements zero-copy data movement between file descriptors using the splice syscall interface. Supports IORING_OP_SPLICE, which transfers data from one file to another (e.g., pipe to socket) without user-space copying. Internally prepares splice descriptors, resolves source and destination FDs, and calls do_splice with appropriate flags. Handles permission validation, offset management, and completion event signaling

### sqpoll.c
Implements Submission Queue Polling (SQPOLL) mode, where a dedicated kernel thread actively polls the submission queue for new entries. This reduces syscall overhead for applications making frequent submissions. The thread binds to a CPU if configured, enters a low-power polling loop, and processes requests directly from the ring buffer. Implements synchronization with the main task, SQ polling wake-up logic, and thread lifecycle management

### statx.c
Implements IORING_OP_STATX, which provides extended file metadata beyond what stat() returns. Integrates with the VFS vfs_statx() interface, allowing retrieval of inode-level attributes such as creation time, mount ID, and status flags. Also handles user pointer translation, flags checking, and permission verification.

### sync.c
Implements sync-related operations, including IORING_OP_FSYNC, IORING_OP_SYNC_FILE_RANGE, and IORING_OP_FDATASYNC. These ensure data integrity by flushing file data (and optionally metadata) to persistent storage. The file wraps around vfs_fsync and sync_file_range calls, handling argument validation and request struct preparation. Implements support for both blocking and non-blocking execution, depending on the file system and flags

### tctx.c
Manages per-task io_uring context, tracking state across submissions from a single thread or process. Each io_uring instance has an associated io_uring_task structure initialized during ring creation. This file contains logic to allocate, initialize, and release task-specific data structures, such as personal task work queues, ring references, and request counters. P 

### timeout.c
Implements time-based request operations like IORING_OP_TIMEOUT, IORING_OP_TIMEOUT_REMOVE, and IORING_OP_LINK_TIMEOUT. Uses high-resolution kernel timers (hrtimer) and timeout lists to schedule request completions based on time expiration. Also provides infrastructure to cancel or remove active timers via a unique request key. Integrates tightly with linked request chains, ensuring that dependent requests can be cancelled or completed if a timeout occurs. 

### truncate.c
Implements truncate-related operations (IORING_OP_TRUNCATE, IORING_OP_FTRUNCATE) for altering the length of a file. Integrates with the VFS truncate path and handles argument translation from user space. Performs permission checks, resolves the file descriptor or path, and applies length changes. Supports both path-based and file descriptor-based truncation, with optional async execution. Important for applications that dynamically adjust log or data file sizes

### uring_cmd.c
Implements the IORING_OP_URING_CMD mechanism, allowing kernel modules or drivers to define custom commands submitted via io_uring. Provides a flexible interface where user-space can pass opaque data blocks to kernel-space modules, which interpret and execute them. This is typically used by subsystems like io_uring-aware drivers or storage engines. Includes memory pinning, argument validation, and integration with command dispatch handler

### waitid.c
Implements IORING_OP_WAITID, which waits for a specific process or process group to change state (e.g., exit, stop). Wraps around the waitid() syscall logic, allowing io_uring to provide process monitoring as an async request. The implementation handles the translation of siginfo_t structures into a user-provided buffer, while preserving proper access rights and signal context. Includes support for handling special wait flags like WEXITED, WSTOPPED, and WCONTINUED, and integrates cancellation if the target process state changes before timeout or cancellation

### xattr.c
Implements extended attribute operations for io_uring, specifically IORING_OP_GETXATTR, IORING_OP_SETXATTR, IORING_OP_REMOVEXATTR, and IORING_OP_LISTXATTR. These calls wrap around the kernel’s xattr interface and enable user-space applications to manage metadata associated with files. Handles path resolution, buffer management, and permission checking. Each operation supports async execution and includes error propagation, buffer length validation, and careful user-pointer dereferencing. Integrates with linked operations and can act as metadata preconditions in data pipelines.

### zcrx.c
Implements support for Zero-Copy Receive (ZC RX) logic within io_uring, a feature that allows high-throughput socket receive operations without copying data into user buffers. Instead, the kernel writes directly into shared memory regions registered by the user. This file defines and handles the logic for IORING_OP_RECV_ZC, including the setup of registered buffers, buffer selection, and integration with socket callbacks
